= oVirt Ruby SDK Packaging

== Introduction

This directory contains the files required to package the SDK for
packaging systems other than the Ruby gem packaging system.

== RPM

To build the RPM simply run the `build.sh` script. It will download the
`.gem` file from `rubygems.org` and then will package it.
